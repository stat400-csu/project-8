Group 8 Project for STAT400 @ CSU
To access the code for reproducing the final paper, go to the folder " Stat 400 Final Project" and then click on the file "Final Paper.Rmd".  The Presentation was made using powerpoint as we were not able to format our figures to the extent we wanted in R markdown.  So there is no code for reproducing the presentation.  However, the file containing the powerpoint is titled "Stat400_Presentation_updated" if you would like to view it through github.
